# JFMP Burn Prioritisation
Updating JFMP prioritisation process for new Bushfire Risk Modelling Framework


**The Basic logic**

Each simulated bushfire is run at a future point in time using past fire history only (noJFMP), then at the same point in time with planned burns from the Joint Fuel Management Program included (fullJFMP). All changes in modelled houseloss are attributed back to the planned burns (the burn score) based on the size of the overlap between the planned burn as a proportion of the overlap between all burns and the simulated bushfire.

Burn scores are summed for all ignitions to create a final burn score for each planned burn.

# Processing

### 1. Prepare spatial data in ArcGIS
   1. Ensure required fields exist and are populated. These fields are:
       * name        - name of the burn
       * treatment_  - coded id of the burn, including district and type
       * category    - type of burn
       * T_TYPE_FMS  - type of burn
       * jfmpyrpr    - proposed year/season of treatment (as single 4 digit numeric year)
       
      > Note: Capitalisation shouldn't matter (but I had better check this!)
      > 
      > Note: The field for type of burn keeps changing. Pick one and update the WHERE statement in 2.3 below if required.
  
   2. Export to new shapefile
       * Ensure Output Coordinate System is set to GDA 1994 VICGRID94 (3111) 
   
### 2. Convert the JFMP shapefiles to 180m grid data 

   1. Create a new schema in risk2temp_db to hold/store our data
      
      ```sql
      CREATE SCHEMA jfmp_2022_test;
      ```
   
   2. Import JFMP shapefile to risk2temp database

      Upload the shapefile using PostGIS Shapefile Import/Export manager
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100050237/227848065-9e6c8ea4-d36b-4bf6-8c80-e75c971c4e9c.png" width="500" />
         > Note: You can run this tool without installing PostGIS by downloading the latest zip bundle from http://download.osgeo.org/postgis/windows/ and extracting just the /bin/ folder.
   
   3. Repair shapefile geometry (because ESRI's idea of valid geometry is different to PostGIS)
   
      ```sql
      UPDATE jfmp_2022_test.jfmp_shapefile SET geom = ST_MakeValid(geom);
      ```
   
   4. Join JFMP shapefile to 180m grid cells
    
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE jfmp_2022_test.jfmp_xy180 AS
         SELECT
             a.cellid,
             b.name,
             b.treatment_ as burnnum,
             cast(left(b.jfmpyearpr, 4) as bigint) as jfmp_year,
             a.delwp_district,
             a.delwp_region,
             a.treatable
         FROM
             reference_brau.grid_cell_180m_treatability a
         INNER JOIN jfmp_2022_test.jfmp_draft_2022 b
         ON
             ST_Contains(b.geom, a.geom_centroid)
        WHERE
           a.treatable = 1 AND b.t_type_fms in ('FUEL REDUCTION', 'ECOLOGICAL') -- or b.category in ('FUEL REDUCTION', ECOLOGICAL)
      ;
      ```
 
        > Note: The base treatability is a raster layer with 30m pixel resolution. reference_brau.grid_cell_180m_treatability is down-scaled to 180m resolution using a simple binary join. For our purposes this is _mostly_ fine, as the process only cares about the proportion of the planned burn that is treatable. It may slightly over or under-state very small burns, but their small scale will largely offset any inaccuracy.
        > reference_brau.grid_cell_180m_treatability should not be used for queries where spatial precision is required. 
 
### 3. Process Phoenix data in AWS Athena

   1. Create a new schema in Athena to hold/store our data
      
      ```sql
      CREATE SCHEMA jfmp_2022_test;
      ```
      
   2. Export jfmp_xy180 table from risk2temp to Athena database
      * Export to jfmp_xy180.csv
      * Upload to S3 bucket
      * Import to Athena
      ```sql
      CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `test_jfmp_2022`.`jfmp_xy180` (
        `cellid` bigint,
        `name` string,
        `burnnum` string,
        `jfmp_year` bigint,
        `delwp_district` string,
        `delwp_region` string,
        `treatable` integer
      )
      ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe'
      WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
       'serialization.format' = ',',
       'field.delim' = ','
      )
      LOCATION 's3://tempgippsland/' -- replace with location of jfmp_xy180.csv
      TBLPROPERTIES ('skip.header.line.count'='1')
      ;
      ```

   3. Calculate year1 burn scores

```sql
-- summarise the intersections of the JFMP polygons and Phoenix fire areas.
-- allocate burn weighting to each burn based on the number of intersecting treatable cells in the burn divided by the total number of treatable cells 
-- in all intersecting burns within the ignition's fire path.

   (select 
       b.name, b.burnnum, b.jfmp_year,
       b.burn_score_firesize as burn_score_firesize_raw,
       cast(b.burn_score_firesize as real)/cast(m_fs.max_score_firesize as real) as burn_score_firesize_normalised,
       b.burn_score_houseloss as burn_score_houseloss_raw,
       cast(b.burn_score_houseloss as real)/cast(m_hl.max_score_houseloss as real) as burn_score_houseloss_normalised
   from burn_scores b, max_score_firesize m_fs, max_score_houseloss m_hl 
   order by burn_score_houseloss_normalised desc
   );
```

   9. Make Phoenix burn score summary view

```sql
create view burn_score_phx as
with 
    -- calculate burn scores per ignition then sum them back to the burn
    burn_scores as (
        select b.name, b.burnnum, b.jfmp_year,
            sum(b.burn_weight * coalesce(hl.loss_diff,0)) as burn_score_phx
        from weighted_burns b
        left join ignition_houseloss_phx hl on hl.ignitionid = b.ignitionid
        group by b.name, b.burnnum, b.jfmp_year
    ),
    max_score as (
        select min(burn_score_phx) as max_burn_score_phx from burn_scores -- !! Note: burn scores are change values; negative is a reduction in house loss !!
    )
(select 
    b.name, b.burnnum, b.jfmp_year,
    b.burn_score_phx as burn_score_raw,
    cast(b.burn_score_phx as real)/cast(m.max_burn_score_phx as real) as burn_score_normalised
from burn_scores b, max_score m
order by burn_score_normalised desc
);
```

   10. Combine burn score tables

```sql
create or replace view burn_score_combined as(
    select a.name, a.burnnum, a.jfmp_year, 
           a.burn_score_raw as score_raw_phx_hl, 
           a.burn_score_normalised as score_norm_phx_hl,
           coalesce(b.burn_score_houseloss_raw, 0) as score_raw_bn_hl, 
           coalesce(b.burn_score_houseloss_normalised, 0) as score_norm_bn_hl,
           coalesce(b.burn_score_firesize_raw, 0) as score_raw_bn_fs, 
           coalesce(b.burn_score_firesize_normalised, 0) as score_norm_bn_fs
    from burn_score_phx a left join burn_score_bn b on a.name = b.name and a.burnnum = b.burnnum and a.jfmp_year = b.jfmp_year
    );
```
   11. Export to risk2temp_db and join to original JFMP shapefile

## Some thoughts and notes

Some ignitions have an increase in house loss in the fulljfmp runs. These are included and distributed among burn units in the same way as reductions in house loss. The increases are generally outweighed by reductions, but some planned burns still have a negative value. If this isn't considered realistic, we could attribute only the reductions in house loss and ignore any increases.

Additional insight and prioritisation information could be gained by:
1. Adding burn_score_phx_ha and burn_score_bn_ha to the final output (divide burn scores by the total burn hectares). 
   
   There's currently a bias towards larger burn sizes, which is correct but doesn't enable evaluation of options, e.g. two smaller burns that would produce a larger risk reduction than one larger burn.
   
3. Using district average cost/hectare figures to reweight burn scores (risk reduction per dollar). 

   This would identify the most _efficient_ burns.
   
6. Weighting priority by district/region residual risk.

   The prioritisation currently works by ranking burns by effect without consideration of whether that effect is required. Parts of the state with highly treatable risk will tend to be prioritised - even if they are below target, over parts of the state which are above target.
